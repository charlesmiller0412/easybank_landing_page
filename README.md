## My process

### **Built with**

-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
-   [Tailwind CSS](https://https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### **What I learned**

**Next.JS** -
As my first Next project, I can say I'm not a big fan of the Image component. There are a lot of limitations that could simply be avoided by using Create-React-App for a react project.

**Typescript** -
While there wasnt any usage of types in this project, I still wanted to see the differences between TS and JS...which there aren't any besides defining the type and having the ability to update the target version for formatting.

**Tailwind** -
I wanted to have a project where I used this...and now I do. I'm not a big fan of writing my classes inline with Javascript. This can get very confusing and add to many duplicate or unnecessary classes.Now I can say that I've used it and know how to use it...but most likely won't unless it's a requirement. I prefer Bootstrap or custom CSS properties.

### **Useful resources**

_Keep in mind that I only use documentation for my projects as this is the best way to understand the tool being used._
